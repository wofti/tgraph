INSTALLATION
	Make a symbolic link to tgraph.py, e.g. by entering:
		ln -s ~/tgraph/tgraph.py ~/bin/tgraph.py
	Or copy tgraph.py, tdata.py and tgraph.txt into the same directory
	(e.g. ~/bin). Also make sure that tgraph.py is executable
	(chmod a+x tgraph.py).

	Since tgraph.py is written in python, you also need to install python,
	plus the python packages tkinter, tkinter.ttk, numpy and matplotlib.
	To get all these on a current Debian system, it suffices to enter:
		apt install python3-matplotlib

	tgraph.py was written for python3, but it will also run	with python2.
	The version it uses depends on which version the command python
	points to. On a current Debian system this should be set by:
		apt install python-is-python3
